#### Press the angry one's buttons in a variety of ways (use words (embed) or physical pokes with /poke)
* /poke to physically provoke
* /button Send a taunting message
#### Check the status of their rage (Stewing quietly, audible growling, visible vein popping, the temperature is higher than it was a minute ago).
* /ragelevel

* /bonk @user
#### Appease or wait for the rage to subside (5 bonks).
